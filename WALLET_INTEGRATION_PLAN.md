#### **Phase 3: Production Ready (Priority: LOW)**
- [ ] **Mainnet Configuration**
  - Switch from devnet to mainnet when ready
  - Add network selection dropdown
  - Environment-based configuration

- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - Better error messages for users
  - Fallback mechanisms for wallet failures
  - Network connection error handling

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize wallet connection speed
  - Reduce bundle size
  - Improve loading times

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Strategy**

#### **Safe Addition Process**
1. **Test After Each Step** - Never add multiple features at once
2. **Isolate Changes** - Keep wallet logic in separate components
3. **Incremental Testing** - Verify functionality at each step
4. **Rollback Capability** - Keep working commits for easy rollback

#### **Known Issues to Avoid**
- ❌ **Import Order Conflicts** - Keep React imports first
- ❌ **Multiple Adapters at Once** - Add one wallet adapter at a time
- ❌ **Complex Async Operations** - Add balance fetching separately
- ❌ **CSS Import Issues** - Keep CSS imports in wrapper component

#### **File Structure**
```
components/
├── WalletWrapper.tsx (✅ Complete)
└── WalletTestMode.tsx (🔄 Planned)

App.tsx (🔄 Incremental updates)
index.tsx (✅ Complete)
```
