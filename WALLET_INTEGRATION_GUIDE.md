];
```

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser** to `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Install a Solana wallet** (if you don't have one):
   - [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) - Chrome/Brave extension
   - [Solflare](https://solflare.com/) - Web wallet
   - [Backpack](https://www.backpack.app/) - Desktop app

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Devnet**: Currently configured for Solana devnet (test network)
- **No Real Money**: Devnet uses fake SOL for testing
- **Production Ready**: Easy to switch to mainnet when ready

## 🎨 Customization

### Wallet Button Styling
The wallet buttons use custom Tailwind classes:
```typescript
className="!bg-gradient-to-r !from-purple-500 !to-pink-500 hover:!from-purple-600 hover:!to-pink-600"
```

### Network Switching
To switch to mainnet (real money):
```typescript
const network = 'mainnet-beta'; // Change from 'devnet'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Wallet not connecting**: Make sure wallet extension is installed and unlocked
2. **Network errors**: Check internet connection and wallet network settings
3. **Button styling issues**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly loaded

### Debug Mode
Open browser console (F12) to see wallet connection logs and any errors.

## 📈 Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
- **SOL Payments**: Add game entry fees or rewards
- **NFT Integration**: Award NFTs for high scores
- **Leaderboards**: Track scores by wallet address
- **Tournaments**: Multi-player competitions with prizes

### Production Deployment
