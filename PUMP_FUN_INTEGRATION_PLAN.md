### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Strategy**

#### **Safe Addition Process**
1. **Test After Each Step** - Never add multiple features at once
2. **Isolate Changes** - Keep Pump.fun logic in separate service files
3. **Incremental Testing** - Verify functionality at each step
4. **Rollback Capability** - Keep working commits for easy rollback
5. **No Direct App.tsx Changes** - Use component composition instead

#### **File Structure Plan**
```
services/
├── pumpFunService.ts (🔄 New - Pump.fun API integration)
├── prizeService.ts (🔄 New - Prize distribution logic)
└── walletService.ts (🔄 New - Enhanced wallet operations)

components/
├── PrizeClaim.tsx (🔄 New - Prize claim component)
├── PrizePool.tsx (🔄 New - Prize pool display)
└── WalletWrapper.tsx (✅ Existing - Keep unchanged)

App.tsx (🔄 Minimal changes - Only add prize components)
```

#### **Known Issues to Avoid**
- ❌ **Direct App.tsx Modifications** - Use component composition
- ❌ **Complex State Management** - Keep prize logic isolated
- ❌ **CSS Import Conflicts** - Use existing Tailwind classes
- ❌ **Import Order Problems** - Keep React imports first
- ❌ **Wallet Adapter Conflicts** - Don't modify WalletWrapper

### 🎮 **User Experience Goals**

#### **Current Experience**
- ✅ Clean wallet connection on main screen
- ✅ Real-time connection status
- ✅ Beautiful gradient styling
- ✅ No black screen issues
- ✅ Smooth game flow with proper error handling

#### **Target Experience**
- 🎯 Winner sees prize amount on game over screen
- 🎯 One-click prize claim with wallet confirmation
- 🎯 Real-time prize pool balance display
- 🎯 Transaction confirmation and receipt
- 🎯 Optional: Custom token rewards from Pump.fun

### 🚀 **Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Research and Setup (30 minutes)**
1. **Research Pump.fun Integration**
   ```bash
   # Research Pump.fun documentation
   # Identify API endpoints and SDK options
   # Understand fee structure and token creation
   ```

2. **Create Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/pump-fun-integration
   git push -u origin feature/pump-fun-integration
   ```

3. **Set Up Prize Wallet**
   - Create new Solana wallet for prize pool
